# VideoKiosk
This code shows how we can limit user interface of Cisco video devices, so that it can be used as Video Kiosk in remote office of a bank, for example. 
Customers of a bank can use video device to have video communication with agent, but we want to make it simple for use and limit some default options like: place video call to any SIP URI destination, start whiteboarding, join Webex session, change audio settings or place video on mute.
